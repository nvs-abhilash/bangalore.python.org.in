BangPypers hosted its October meetup on October 19, 2024, at Postman, welcoming over 40 enthusiastic participants, including many first-time attendees (including some college students!) eager to dive into the vibrant Python community. The event featured talks about leveraging GenAI agents, core Python and API testing.

We kicked off the meetup with a brief introduction session. This provided an excellent opportunity for everyone to get to know each other and set the stage for the day's presentations.

Our first speaker, Indivar Mishra, delivered an engaging talk on "[Fictional Commentator using Streamlit + Google's Vertex AI](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/39)". Indivar showcased his pet project a fictional commentator. Indivar demonstrated how he used Google Vertex AI function calling capability to commentate cricket match using popular sitcom characters.

Next, Tushar Sadhwani presented an interesting session on "[pip install new syntax](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/35)". Tushar talked about multiple ways that you can modify the Python syntax parsing logic to allow custom syntax. Tushar specifically talked about how you can use `() =>` syntax (which is not a valid Python syntax) for lambda functions. Audiance found the talk interesting and was curious on how to apply the same on their own projects.

Following a short break, we resumed with a talk by Shreyas Panduranga, who introduced "[Performance Testing in Postman](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/41)". Shreyas explained how Postman has simplified performance tesing of APIs with their new "Performance Testing" feature.

The meetup concluded with two lightning talks. First lightning talk was presented by Shubham on Python HPX. Shubham presented a tool for generating Python bindings for C++ code which can boost native python code with minimal code change.

The second lightning talk was presented by Abhik on "Issues with Associative Addition" where he made the audiance aware of how floating point operation works in Python (or any language), and why for some numbers addition is not associative!

We finally ended the event with an informal networking session and a tasty lunch at Postman office. We extend our heartfelt thanks to all the speakers for their valuable contributions and to our participants for their active engagement.
