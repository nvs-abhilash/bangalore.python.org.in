After an awesome [PyCon India in Sept-Oct in Hyderabad](https://in.pycon.org/2023/), we organised the next edition of the meetup on the 25th of November at Cyware, HSR Bangalore. About 30 people turned up to the [event](https://www.meetup.com/bangpypers/events/296815122/).

[Tushar Sadhwani](https://twitter.com/tushar) started out the first talk discussing ['Making Python much faster, using type hints'](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/16).

We took a short break and returned to the second talk by Saptak on 'Does your Django application have proper security headers'.

We had one lightning talk by Nagendra on ['Deploying a streamlit app as an executable'](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/17).
