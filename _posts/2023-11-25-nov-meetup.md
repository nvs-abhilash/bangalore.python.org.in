After an awesome [PyCon India in Sept-Oct in Hyderabad](https://in.pycon.org/2023/), we organised the next edition of the meetup on the 25th of November at Cyware, HSR Bangalore. About 30 people turned up to the [event](https://www.meetup.com/bangpypers/events/296815122/).

[Tushar Sadhwani](https://twitter.com/tusharisanerd) started out the first talk discussing ['Making Python much faster, using type hints'](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/16). We got a detailed aspect of type hints and useful libraries like `mypy` and `mypyc` alongside exciting live coding examples.

We took a short break and returned to the second talk by [Saptak S](https://twitter.com/Saptak013) on 'Does your Django application have proper security headers'. While this talk on built around Django app security headers, it can be extended across any web framework. We learnt about web requests by analysing a website live and check security headers. Django middlewares can be configured and general practices is quite necessary first steps to securing your webpage.
