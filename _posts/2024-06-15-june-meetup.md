BangPypers hosted its June meetup on June 15, 2024, at Cyware, welcoming over 30 enthusiastic participants, including many first-time attendees (including some college students!) eager to dive into the vibrant Python community. The event featured talks about leveraging LLMs, a better way of shipping Python code, and an improved web framework on top of Django.

We kicked off the meetup with a brief introduction session. This provided an excellent opportunity for everyone to get to know each other and set the stage for the day's presentations.

Our first speaker, Keith, delivered an engaging talk on "[Creating Streamlit Apps using NCBI APIs and Google Gemini](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/30)". Keith demonstrated how to leverage NCBI APIs and Google Gemini to build dynamic and interactive Streamlit applications. Attendees appreciated the practical approach, gaining valuable insights into integrating these powerful tools for their projects. Keith also shared some insights about his background in the BioTech industry.

Next, Tushar Sadhwani presented an innovative session on "[Replacing PyInstaller with 100 Lines of Code](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/31)". Tushar walked us through a simplified yet effective alternative to PyInstaller, showcasing a lightweight solution that could significantly streamline the process of packaging Python applications. His talk sparked intriguing discussions about efficiency and best practices in Python development. Tushar also shared some useful tools like [makeself](https://makeself.io/) and his own very useful projects [yen](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/yen) and [packaged](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani/packaged). After his planned talk, Tushar also demonstrated a fun project on how to play Flappy Bird to pass time in a boring Zoom call. The project demonstrated how to work with moving windows in Mac.

Following a short break, we resumed with a talk by Harsh Shah, who introduced "[Zango - A New Python Web Framework](https://github.com/bangpypers/meetup-talks/issues/32)". Harsh explained how [Zango](https://github.com/Healthlane-Technologies/Zango) simplifies building enterprise-ready custom business applications, highlighting its unique features and advantages over existing frameworks. The live demonstrations and practical examples helped attendees understand Zango's potential and applications in real-world scenarios.

The meetup concluded with lightning talks. We had one talk from Anand, a veteran community member, about "Building a Cross Platform File Explorer in 50 lines". Anand did a live coding session and implemented an entire file explorer in 5 minutes with the help of GitHub Copilot. Although the demo was awesome, the audience was also impressed by the sheer speed Anand was able to write the demo from scratch with the help of AI.

We finally ended the event with an informal networking session. We extend our heartfelt thanks to all the speakers for their valuable contributions and to our participants for their active engagement.
